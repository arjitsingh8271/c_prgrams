/* C program to print all twin primes in a given range of numbers using array.

   Explanation :

   Given an integer n. we need to print all twin prime number pairs between 1 to n.
   A Twin prime are those numbers which are prime and having a difference of two ( 2 ) between the two prime numbers.
   In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two.
   Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes;
   an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.
   Usually, the pair (2, 3) is not considered to be a pair of twin primes. Since 2 is the only even prime,
   this pair is the only pair of prime numbers that differ by one;
   thus twin primes are as closely spaced as possible for any other two primes.
   The first few twin prime pairs are :

   (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), 
   (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73), (101, 103), 
   (107, 109), (137, 139), â€¦etc.
